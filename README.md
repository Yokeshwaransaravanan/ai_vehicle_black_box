AI-Driven Vehicle Black Box for Electric Vehicles (EVs)
Overview

This project implements an AI-driven Vehicle Black Box specifically for Electric Vehicles (EVs), designed to monitor and display crucial data including the vehicle's location and energy consumption in real-time. The system leverages AI technologies for data processing and utilizes hardware like the NVIDIA Jetson Nano to run these processes efficiently.
Key Features

    Real-Time Location Tracking:
        Objective: Continuously track and display the vehicle's geographic location.
        How It Works: The system uses GPS data to determine the vehicle's current location, which is displayed on a map and updated in real-time. This helps in tracking vehicle movements and ensuring safe and efficient route planning.

    Energy Consumption Monitoring:
        Objective: Monitor and display real-time energy usage to optimize vehicle performance.
        How It Works: The system measures the vehicle's energy consumption using sensors and calculates key metrics such as voltage, current, and power. This data is displayed in real-time to help manage energy usage effectively and improve the vehicle’s efficiency.

Technology Stack

    TensorFlow: Used for AI-driven data analysis and predictive modeling.
    NVIDIA Jetson Nano: Provides the hardware platform for real-time data processing and model execution.
    Python: The programming language used for developing the data processing and model training scripts.
